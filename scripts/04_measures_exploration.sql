/*
Based on these metrics, the business generates significant Total Sales of over 29 million, distributed across 27,659 orders.
A key analytical highlight is the exceptional data integrity, as 100% of the customers (18,484) registered in the system 
have also placed an order. 
In our further analysis, we will calculate the Estimated Average Order Value (AOV) by dividing Total Sales by Total Orders, 
and the Average Quantity per Order by dividing Total Quantity by Total Orders. 
These calculations will clearly demonstrate that the current strategy is successfully focused on selling high-value products.
